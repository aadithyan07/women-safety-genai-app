# Women Safety GenAI App
A Generative AI–powered women safety solution designed to provide instant alerts, real-time risk prediction, and intelligent emergency support using multimodal AI capabilities.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement
Women’s safety remains a critical challenge due to delayed response, lack of accessible emergency tools, and limited situational awareness. Traditional apps fail because:
- Manual triggering is difficult during real danger.
- No predictive intelligence.
- No automated communication with authorities.

---

## 💡 Solution: Women Safety GenAI App
A smart GenAI-based mobile app that:
- Detects danger automatically using voice, sensor data, and surroundings.
- Sends instant alerts to police and emergency contacts.
- Tracks live location.
- Generates AI-based risk levels.
- Provides voice-activated SOS.

## 🧠 Key Features
### **1. AI SOS Detection (Multimodal GenAI)**
- Detects panic/kidnap-like voice patterns.
- Uses accelerometer data to detect sudden movement/shakes.
- Auto-triggers SOS when the user cannot.

### **2. One-Tap Emergency Alert**
Sends:
- Live location
- User profile
- Nearby CCTV/landmark data (optional)

### **3. Risk Prediction Engine**
Analyzes:

- User movement pattern  
To predict **risk levels** (Low / Medium / High).

### **4. Secure Cloud Dashboard (For Police)**
Police receive:
- Alert notification
- Live location tracking
- Risk explanation generated by GenAI
